The Neurotheque, affiliated with the Functional Neuroimaging Unit (UNF) installed at the University Institute of Geriatrics of Montreal ([IUGM](https://iugm.ca/)), is a data acquisition platform dedicated to electrophysiology and particularly to wireless electroencephalography (EEG). Our center has all the necessary equipment for setting up EEG acquisitions during various cognitive tasks and offers the possibility to use a VR headset simultaneously with the EEG. The Neurothèque thus allows data acquisition during naturalistic paradigms (video games, movies, social interactions), as well as more classic neuropsychological tasks.

Our team is also committed to providing you with technical support and training services for the setup, acquisition, and analysis of your data.

## Access

The Neurothèque is located in room RS718, in the basement of IUGM. To get there, go to the entrance of the UNF as indicated on [this page](https://unf-montreal.ca/documentation/facility/), then take the corridor that leads to the CRIUGM. Next, take the corridor immediately to your left, and go down one floor using the stairs at the end of this second corridor. You will then arrive at the basement of the Institute, and the simulation room will be on your right (RS078). The Neurothèque can be accessed through a second door in room RS078. To obtain the codes to unlock these doors, please contact the Neurothèque team.
